            My first experience with web development was an intersection between my interests in coding and psychology, as it was a
                <a href="/projects.html">mental-health focused web application</a> that
            I worked on under the direction of Yale Computer Science Faculty. That project led me to realize how important 
            it is that we use technology to aid our communities and drive change in the world, and that technology and
                psychology can, and should go hand in hand. 
            My interests in cognitive Science and computer science led me to pursue a joint major in psychology and 
            Computer science so I could continue to develop 
            my coding skills while learning about psychological principles to aid my designs.

            As a minority in STEM and a person that discovered CS relatively late, I am also dedicated to giving younger students the opportunity to 
            develop the confidence they need to pursue CS as they get older. During the school year, I volunteer as a CS teacher to children through
                <a href="https://www.codehavenyale.com/"> Code Haven Yale</a>, and in summer 2020 I will be volunteering online through <a href="https://www.the-cs.org/">The Coding School</a>.
